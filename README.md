# ðŸ“·Visual Object Recognition Program
- Project Duration : 2023.01 ~ 2023.02
- Project Description : Embedded system designed for recognizing and defining objects captured by a camera using deep learning-trained image data. (data : Imagenet_2017).
---
Constructed both the embedded system and the computational pipeline, developing a Python algorithm for image classification in a TensorFlow session, and interpreting results in LabVIEW program designed for image reception.

## LabVIEW
- Output : Visual Object Recognition
- When the camera captures an object, the program will detect the object and classify it based on the training image data.

- converting the data type, which is used to store images and is different from the data type handled in Python, into a data type that can be used for both.

### Step4. Object Recognition and Classification using Python Algorithm
